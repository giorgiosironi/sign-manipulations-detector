This project implements the algorithm from the included sign_manipulations.pdf paper. It has been created as part of my exam for the course Methods and techniques for image processing at Politecnico di Milano, polo di Como.

Requirements
The code depends on the VLFeat library (Matlab Api).

Credits
The authors of the paper are Hany Farid, Valentina Conotter and Giulia Boato. I have implemented all the Matlab code.
