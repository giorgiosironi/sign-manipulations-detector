This project implements the algorithm from the included sign_manipulations.pdf paper. It has been created as part of my exam for the course Methods and technologies for image processing at Politecnico di Milano, polo di Como.

Requirements
The code depends on the VLFeat library (Matlab Api).
http://www.vlfeat.org/
Make sure to modify path() to include the VLFeat source files on your system.
For running the suite of unit tests, you'll need the official Matlab xUnit Test Framework.

Credits
The authors of the paper are Hany Farid, Valentina Conotter and Giulia Boato. I have implemented all the Matlab code.
